I am a Masters student at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, majoring in Computer Science. I am planning to shift to Jekyll and will try updating this blog with the interesting and essential stuff I learn everyday. Looking forward to a great journey!

The title has been inspired from an announcer in DoTA2. Link: [Rick and Morty Annoucer Pack mp3 DLC](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/media/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/74/Dlc_rick_and_morty_announcer_about_to_start_03.mp3)
