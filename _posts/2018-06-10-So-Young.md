I am trying to write a series of blog posts on explaining programming questions on Leetcode and trying to make it easier for people to code (and prepare for interviews too!).

## [Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/) 
In this question, we are given an absolute path of a file or directory (UNIX style). We have to try to simplify it. 

Let's first work on the test cases. 
1. We can have normal UNIX paths like: \home
2. We use ".." to go back one level in UNIX: \A\B\.. makes you go back to A.
3. We have to skip the multiple redundant forward slashes (they are irrelevant) and we have to skip some cases like "." and " " (which represents the original folder location).

For storing the directories or files we encounter while traversing through the array, we will use a Doubly Ended Queue (or Deque in Java). This would help us to push a directory to the top of the queue (or head) and remove an element from the head itself.

We will create a list of strings to skip empty spaces and ".". Let's name this list **skip**.

We will push the directory strings to our queue if it's a valid one. Here valid means it is a string and is not equal to the strings present in the skip list.

Here's the code for the same:
