### "Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. We're all going to die. Come watch TV." - Rick, Rixty Minutes, S01E08.
I guess I am gonna start every post of mine with a one liner from one of my favorite TV shows till date: Rick and Morty.
## Gists!
One of the things I learnt today is about Gist. [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) is an amazing way to share your code. Sharing snippets? Single Files? Entire Applications? Use Gists!  
No need to use pastebin for sharing code anymore (unless you are just using it for temporary copy pasting stuff).
There are 2 types of gists: Public and Secret. Ready to share your ideas with the world? More of an open-source person? Use Public gists.  
Wanna jot down a bucket list? Wanna write some code for your own startup? Use Secret gists and share the URL!
Once you publish your gist as public, it remains public throughout it's lifetime. It isn't convertible to a secret one (and vice versa).  
You can use the [Discover](https://gist.github.com/discover) feature to go through various public gists, but secret gists are not visible anywhere on the tab. Once you share the URL with someone, they can view your gist.  
Anonymous gists can be created without logging into Github (secret or public).  

There are various moves to play with Gists.
- You can download the Gist using the zip download option.
- You can embed the Gist by copying the embed text and pasting it into your JS code.
- You can fork or clone Github Gists because they are Github repos at the end! Check out more about [Forking and Cloning gists](https://help.github.com/articles/forking-and-cloning-gists/).
